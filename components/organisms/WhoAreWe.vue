        Thereâ€™s a monumental shift happening among people who make music and
        earnings. Modern artists want to be independent and still acquire
        wealth's for themselves. They want to create, collaborate and promote in
        new ways, pushing culture forward while building a passion economy. They
        want to build their brand and run their business on their own terms.
        This can only be possible digitally.
